<p>If you’re reading this, I assume you know what <a href="https://www.mbl.edu/education/advanced-research-training-courses/course-offerings/strategies-and-techniques-analyzing-microbial-population-structures" class="external-link">STAMPS</a>
is and have some interest in applying – but just in case, STAMPS is a
~10 day intensive training course offered at the Marine Biological
Laboratory. Our curriculum is designed to help researchers analyze their
microbiome data, focusing on bioinformatics and statistics skills and
knowledge. It’s primarily taught by methods developers for their target
users, and we emphasize “getting your hands dirty” in the data. We also
want you to understand the concepts underpinning the tools, so we don’t
teach click-button / copy-and-paste tools. Past participants of the
course have described it as transformative for their science, highly
impactful on their careers, and a ton of fun. If you have questions
about the course or would like to learn more, please check out the <a href="https://www.mbl.edu/education/advanced-research-training-courses/course-offerings/strategies-and-techniques-analyzing-microbial-population-structures" class="external-link">official</a>
or <a href="https://mblstamps.github.io/" class="external-link">unofficial</a> course website
for more information.</p>
<p>I’m co-Directing STAMPS 2025 at the MBL with Titus Brown again (our
third year, woo!), and wanted to make some suggestions about how to
write a fantastic STAMPS application. Applications are competitive, with
only ~35 places, and I want you to write the best possible
application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="background-on-applying">Background on applying<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background-on-applying"></a>
</h2>
<p>The most important thing is this: <strong>if you think the course
could benefit you, please apply</strong>! Don’t talk yourself out of
applying just because it’s competitive.</p>
<p>In admissions, we prioritize “How much could this applicant benefit
from the course?” You could think of this as “Did the applicant make a
strong case for why they need their seat?”</p>
<p>There are three main questions on the application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you want to take this course and why at this time? <em>Please
describe how this course will impact your current research program as
well as your long-term career goals. (up to 500 words)</em>
</li>
<li>What do you want us to know about yourself? <em>Please use this
space to discuss the ways you feel you can contribute to this program
and any unique aspects of your personal path as related to your passion
and enthusiasm for science. (up to 500 words)</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Optional</strong>: If you have other accomplishments or
related information that is not reflected on your CV, please feel free
to briefly describe them in the box below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions 2 and 3 are important, but I’m going to focus on Question 1
in this post.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="structuring-your-application">Structuring your application<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#structuring-your-application"></a>
</h2>
<p>Here is the basic structure of a great response to “Why do you want
to take this course and why at this time?”:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I am a [undergrad/MS candidate/PhD candidate/postdoc/PI]. I have
been in that position for [X] years” or some less awkward way to tell us
that you’re a 1st vs 5th year :)<br>
</li>
<li>“The goal of my thesis/postdoc/research program is to study [big
picture question]. I am specifically focusing on [more specific
question/s].”
<ul>
<li>Your application is being reviewed by a committee who have worked in
the microbiome field for many years, so most applicants can be brief
here. If your disease/host organism/biome is really unusual, feel free
to include some additional background.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“I plan to analyze data from [this biome/cohort/study]”, OR “I am
still designing my experiment”. Please go into methodological and
experimental details here as much as you can! i.e., <strong>What data do
you have/want to have, who designed the experiment and collected the
data, and when will you get it?</strong> Here are some hypothetical
examples:
<ul>
<li>I am planning to collect my samples in June-August 2025, and perform
16S sequencing on them in September-October 2025…</li>
<li>I have paired qPCR and RNASeq data from samples I obtained in 2023.
I am planning to additionally collect shotgun sequencing data in
November 2025…</li>
<li>I am in the process of designing my experiment, and expect to have
my samples by June 2027. I have not decided what observations I will
have…</li>
<li>I plan to analyze data collected by my colleague for my first
project, and then design my own experiment and analyze it for my second
project. The data that I have in hand is… and the data I plan to collect
is…</li>
<li>I arranged Sanger sequencing at a core facility on 20 <em>B
fragilis</em> isolates collected in my lab. The data is with the core
and we expect to receive it in February 2025…</li>
<li>and so on. (Yours will probably be very different to <em>all</em> of
the above!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What computational, bioinformatic and/or statistical tools you
intend to use or have used. Here some examples:
<ul>
<li>I have my data and I have no good ideas about what to do with it. I
can open it in Excel…</li>
<li>I have used R (reading in files and making basic plots) and the
command line (including vim) for RNASeq before, but this is the first
microbiome project of my research group and no one around me knows what
to do with this type of data…</li>
<li>I have started the DADA2 vignettes but I’m running into error
messages that I can’t solve. I have some basic R experience (using
packages…) but have never used the command line…</li>
<li>I have run metaphlan on my shotgun data and strainphlan on my
isolate data and have loaded that into python and made some custom
visualizations. I’d like to turn these into publication-ready figures
and have specific questions about the assumptions made by these
tools…</li>
<li>I have built a computational pipeline to train custom HMMs. I’d like
to discuss the nuances of training sequence classification models with
an expert…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants in STAMPS 2024 came from the full spectrum of
backgrounds. We had some very experienced users, people who had never
seen a terminal before, and everything in between. And <em>everyone</em>
learnt something!!!</p>
<p>So, think: “How can I convince them that I am ready to use what I
learn in this course to advance my research?”</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you applied in a previous year, and think the course would still
benefit you, please reapply. Feel free to mention that you have applied
in a previous year – your sustained interest in attending the course
will be viewed positively.</li>
<li>Feel free to tell us about your favourite papers’ analyses! “I would
like to learn how to build a custom BLAST database to search for X” or
“I would like to learn how to make a [volcano plot/pangenome
visualisation/heatmap of distances]”. Show us that you are curious and
motivated to learn!</li>
<li>In addition to specific tools and scientific/methodological
questions that you have, feel free to tell us about other workshops (in
person or online) that you have attended.</li>
<li>Not sure if the course is right for you? <a href="https://github.com/mblstamps/stamps2024/wiki#schedule" class="external-link">Last year’s
schedule and slides</a> may help you get an idea of what we cover (we
update the course every year, though!).</li>
<li>At this time, we don’t have financial aid to offer. <strong>If you
would like to make a gift to support STAMPS participants, please contact
me and Titus. Gifts can make this transformational learning opportunity
more accessible!</strong>
</li>
<li>Dying to get started? <a href="https://astrobiomike.github.io/" class="external-link">Happy Belly Bioinformatics</a> is
my favorite online microbial bioinformatics resource. Anything you learn
in advance of STAMPS will help you get more out of STAMPS.<br>
</li>
<li>Remember that learning is challenging – your brain is rewiring
itself to make new connections! Don’t be discouraged if you feel
overwhelmed by the task of analyzing your data. It might be is difficult
and uncomfortable, but you can do it! Keep trying, and be kind to
yourself. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.<br>
</li>
<li>Questions? Feel free to email me and Titus (preferably both of us on
the same email).</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to see you in Woods Hole in July, and I look forward to
reading your application!</p>
